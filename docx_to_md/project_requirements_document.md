### Project Requirements Document: DOCX to Markdown Converter (R Version)

## 1. Project Overview

This project involves developing a command-line tool using R to convert DOCX files into Markdown (.md) format. The converter is designed primarily for academic purposes, aiming to preserve essential formatting elements such as tabulations, links, images, GIFs, and document structure like indexes. By delivering Markdown files with embedded media, the tool ensures that the fidelity of the original document is maintained as closely as possible, facilitating the integration of DOCX content into Markdown-friendly academic environments.

The primary goal is to ensure smooth and efficient conversion of both individual and multiple DOCX files into a single Markdown file, with real-time progress monitoring and basic error handling to ensure seamless operation. The tool seeks to enhance productivity in academic workflows by simplifying document conversion processes, while also offering git synchronization for version control.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   Conversion of single and multiple DOCX files into a consolidated Markdown file.
*   Preservation of key DOCX formatting, including tabulations, links, indexes, images, and GIFs.
*   Direct embedding of images and GIFs into Markdown.
*   Command-line interface for file selection and processing.
*   Progress bar displaying conversion progress with time elapsed and estimated time remaining.
*   Basic error handling: skipping unsupported DOCX features, saving them in a separate folder, displaying warning messages post-conversion.
*   Git integration for syncing generated Markdown files.
*   Basic logging to support troubleshooting and continual improvement.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Graphical user interface (GUI) at this stage; the focus is on a CLI interaction.
*   Advanced formatting enhancements or corrections beyond what R libraries can handle.
*   Real-time cloud integration except for git synchronization.
*   Extensive error analytics; the focus will be on essential logging and user notifications.

## 3. User Flow

Users will initiate the conversion process via a command-line interface, where they can specify either a single DOCX file or a directory containing multiple files for simultaneous conversion. Upon initiation, users can choose to enable or disable git sync and logging options. Once file selection and desired settings are confirmed, the conversion process commences with a dynamic progress bar indicating both time elapsed and remaining. This feature helps users manage their workflow efficiently, particularly when dealing with large DOCX files.

During conversion, the tool reads DOCX content, including media and formatted structures, and translates it into Markdown syntax, ensuring media and formatting integrity are retained as much as possible. Unsupported features are skipped, logged, and users are notified via warning messages. After conversion, the resultant Markdown document can be automatically synchronized with a user-specified git repository.

## 4. Core Features

    *   Direct embedding of images/GIFs into Markdown.

*   **Progress Monitoring:**

    *   Real-time update with time metrics.

*   **Error Handling and Logging:**

    *   Skip unsupported features, log them, and provide post-process warnings.

*   **Git Synchronization:**

    *   Optional post-conversion git sync.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Development Platform:**

    *   R programming language.

*   **R Libraries and Tools:**

    *   DOCX files adhere to standard formatting.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Formatting Fidelity:**

    *   Some complex DOCX features may not fully convert.
    *   Mitigation via warning messages and logging.

*   **Batch Processing Delays:**

    *   Mitigated through efficient scripting and logging.

*   **Media Embedding Issues:**

    *   Regular testing to ensure stringent markdown compliance.

*   **Git Failures:**

    *   Clear error messaging and fallback strategies.
