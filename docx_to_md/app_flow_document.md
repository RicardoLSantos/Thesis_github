# Introduction

This application is a command-line tool built using R that converts DOCX files into Markdown files. It is designed for academic users who want to preserve essential formatting like tabulation, links, images, GIFs, and indexes when converting documents. The tool is focused on simplicity and efficiency during the conversion process and it integrates features such as batch processing, progress monitoring, basic logging, and git synchronization. Users can use it to merge multiple DOCX files into one cohesive Markdown file, ensuring that the output remains faithful to the original document formatting.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a user launches the tool from their command line, they are greeted with an initialization screen that provides clear instructions about the tool’s academic purpose and capabilities. Although there is no traditional sign-up process, the initial setup involves configuring user preferences such as enabling git synchronization, toggling logging options, and selecting media handling features. For users who plan to integrate their work with git repositories, the tool provides guidance on configuring git credentials. There are helpful prompts that assist users in entering settings, ensuring that they can start converting documents without needing complex user account management.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After the initial configuration, the user is taken to the main interface of the tool. This command-line screen acts as the dashboard where users can input the file path or directory of the DOCX files they wish to convert. The dashboard displays a clear prompt asking the user to specify a single file or a folder containing multiple DOCX files. In addition, the interface shows the currently active settings such as the preference to merge multiple files and whether git synchronization is enabled. This main screen is structured in a simple and understandable way, providing a central hub for all conversion activities and making it easy for users to navigate to the next step of the process.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once the user has selected their DOCX files, the conversion process begins with a focused workflow on the command line. The tool first reads the input files and applies the user’s configuration settings. During the conversion, the application processes each DOCX file one after another and generates Markdown output. The tool carefully converts elements like table structures, hyperlinks, indexes, and embedded images and GIFs. All media are embedded directly into the Markdown file. While the conversion is underway, a progress bar displays both the time elapsed and the estimated time remaining, offering real-time feedback about the ongoing process. The user sees each transition between file readings, conversion status updates, and the final compilation of content into one large Markdown document if batch mode is selected.

## Settings and Account Management

Users have the option to revisit and adjust their conversion settings at any point during the workflow. After the tool starts, settings such as whether to embed media directly, toggle git synchronization, and enable basic logging are configurable through command-line prompts or a configuration file. While there is no dedicated account management system, users manage their preferences in a straightforward manner by updating the tool’s settings before initiating a conversion. Once the conversion is complete, users can also choose to save or update these settings for future operations. The process is designed to transition smoothly back to the main dashboard, ensuring that any changes in preferences are immediately reflected in subsequent conversions.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the tool encounters any issues such as unsupported DOCX features or formatting challenges, it follows a clear error-handling process. Instead of interrupting the conversion, the tool skips any unsupported elements and saves related files in a separate folder. After the conversion has finished, a summary is displayed on the command-line interface, which includes warning messages about any content that was skipped. In cases of connectivity issues with the git synchronization feature or problems reading the input file, the tool displays straightforward error messages that help users understand what went wrong and suggest possible troubleshooting steps. This ensures that even when an error occurs, the user is informed and can continue working with minimal disruption.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

This application takes the user on a straightforward journey from start to finish. The user begins by launching the command-line tool and configuring essential settings without the need for traditional sign-up or sign-in processes. After reaching the main dashboard, the user selects a DOCX file or folder for conversion. The tool then processes each file in sequence, converting content and embedding images and GIFs directly into the Markdown output, all while displaying real-time progress. Any issues encountered during conversion are handled gracefully with appropriate warnings and logs for later analysis. Finally, users have the option to sync the resulting Markdown file with a git repository, seamlessly integrating the tool into academic workflows. The entire experience is designed to be intuitive and efficient, making it clear how each step connects to the next and ensuring that the output maintains high fidelity with the original document's formatting.
