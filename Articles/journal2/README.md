# Proof of Concept Implementation of a Co-Produced Personal Health Record System

This article presents a practical implementation of a co-produced Personal Health Record (coPHR) system that demonstrates the feasibility of integrating Patient-Generated Health Data into clinical practice.

## Key Themes

- Co-Produced Personal Health Record (coPHR) implementation
- Wearable device and smartphone data integration (smartwatches, fitness trackers)
- HL7 FHIR and openEHR practical interoperability
- Local Large Language Models (LLMs) for health data processing
- Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) for health data
- Vital signs monitoring and validation (heart rate, SpO2, activity, sleep)
- User interface design for patients and healthcare providers
- Security, privacy, and data governance in health information systems

## Journal Target

Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) or Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR)
