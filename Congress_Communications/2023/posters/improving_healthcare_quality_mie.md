## Abstract
The Learning Health System (LHS) is an important tool to help healthcare professionals solve problems by collecting, analyzing, interpreting and comparing health data, with the objective of helping patients make the best decision based on their own data, given the best evidence available. We believe partial oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SpO2) and related measurements and calculations can also be candidates for predictions and analysis of health conditions. We intend, at first, to build a Personal Health Record (PHR) that can: exchange data with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from hospitals, propose enhanced self-care, seek a support network, and/or look for healthcare assistance, (primary care or emergency service).

**Keywords:** Learning Health System, Interoperability, Vital signs, Personal Health Record

## Introduction and Problem Description
This poster is a preview of a thesis that will be submitted to the Health Data Science PhD Program from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, Portugal. The thesis will be the first step in the long journey of developing a streaming data platform to back the building of a Learning Health System (LHS) in order to improve healthcare quality and its perceived value.

The main idea behind LHS is the continuous improvement of outcomes through the generation and employment of knowledge during healthcare delivery by the use of informatics, science and enhancement of education, training and performance.

### Interoperability
Has the power to integrate the structure and semantics of health data and prevent loss of meaning of conceptual domains, knowledge in context and formal representation of data. Besides data transportation (HL7 V2, V3 and FHIR), security (HTTPS) and structure and format (CDA, OMOP), health data standards involve vocabulary (SNOMED-CT), terminologies (LOINC) and classifications (ICD-10 and 11) used to describe the real world in healthcare.

### Vital signs
As reported by Hirten, RP. in 2020 regarding COVID-19 infection, pre-diagnostic in healthcare professionals through heart rates measured by smartwatches, participants wore Apple Watch and an app on their smartphones. We believe partial oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SpO2) and related measurements and calculations can also be candidates for predictions and analysis of health conditions, as so sleep pattern, physical activity, environmental noise, body temperature and others that are yet to become measurable through smart devices.

### Literacy
Self-care measures may be proposed to the patient through self-learning, and consequently avoid the clinical condition worsening and seeking help sooner, at a smaller economic and social cost, which can be measured by proper indicators, given adequate data.

## Aim
The cycle of care, research and knowledge discovery and its application into healthcare begins with the patient, as the history and the evolution of the pathophysiology of the disease itself (and its related signs and symptoms) are translated into changes in vital signs (prior to lab and image exams), and those can be recorded into exchangeable, semantically interoperable, meaningful data.

## Methods
We intend to, at this first phase, build a Personal Health Record (PHR) that can exchange and compare data with:
a) best evidence available
b) Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from hospitals

Both with the final objective of proposing enhanced self-care, seek a support network (family, local and/or condition related groups in social media), or look for healthcare assistance (primary care or emergency service).

## Conclusions and future work
LHS are very important tools, but also as very complex. But we must start building it from somewhere. We believe the starting point must be the patient, being at the center of the treatment, but also of the pathophysiology development of the diseases, meaning habits choices (food, exercises, sleep and stress management) and its related recordable and exchangeable early vital signs and symptoms. Still missing and to be addressed at the systematic review are GDPR and Medical Devices Regulation, as so is defining the unique identifier for each patient.
