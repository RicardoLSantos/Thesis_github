# Healthcare Learning Health Systems Research

This repository contains the PhD thesis and related scientific articles on Healthcare Learning Health Systems (LHS) and Health Data Science.
This project is held at Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto in the Health Data Science Doctoral Program (HEADS#2 FMUP), Portugal.
The main subject is Health Data Interoperability (HL7 FHIR, openEHR).
The health data chosen for this first Framework are Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD), and from those, we chose Vital Signs from wearables like smartwatches and smartphones.
For the Proof of Concept, we believe Lifestyle Medicine and its related data from the six pillars is a good starting point.
The main goal is to confront observational data with clinical guidelines and evidence-based practices to improve patient outcomes and healthcare systems.
